# Design to Learn

*Note: NUBBB no longer exists. I have pieced this interview back together (along with the images) based on what I could find.*

## What do you think is something people misunderstand about mindful design?
Mindful design is about awareness. It focuses more on the impact the work has—societally, emotionally, and environmentally—rather than money or status. When I incorporate mindfulness into my design process, and I think this is where the misunderstanding is, I'm prioritizing the experience over the profit.

## What are some of your favourite projects, and what have you learned from them?
Some of my favourite projects that I've worked on have actually been ones that fell through, because those tend to be the ones I learn most from. In terms of other people's projects I've learned from, I've been super into Jack Butcher's work lately. The knowledge—design, business, you name it—he's able to pack into his graphics for Visualize Value easily outweighs the knowledge I gained going to college. I would also argue that Jack's work is a pretty solid example of mindful design.

## What do you think is your greatest responsibility as a designer?
I believe my greatest responsibility as a designer is designing for the future. The work we do as creatives is always directly impacting the future of people and of the planet. It's important to remember that even the smallest teams have the potential to hold tremendous influence in the world, and that the work we do is not for us, it's not even for the businesses we're working with and for—it's for future generations. Our responsibility as creatives is to shape positive change for future creatives and the planet.

## As designers and storytellers, we have the ability to shape minds and change people's behaviour. What do you think would help inspire more of us to actively choose to use our craft for the reason?
Better access to knowledge + education alternatives! We're so lucky today that we have access to so much information, yet there's still stigma surrounding learning that isn't the 'traditional' college route. Some of the best advice I've been given, the most useful knowledge I've gained, and the most inspirational people I've met have all been through social media. If it wasn't for social media and the tools it's provided me with, I don't know where I would be as a creative. I think there's a lot of passion that goes uncultivated, and if we eliminate the stigma associated with learning outside of traditional school environments, we'd see a lot less confusion and fear, and a lot more budding creatives (or any other career path!) diving into the things they're passionate about.

## What's your message or advice to the new and upcoming to the design profession?
Passion projects are your best friend! No matter how hard you try, you won't find your style through school projects alone—it's a process that ultimately takes a lot of time. Working on passion projects will help you get more clear on the kind of design you want to be doing, you'll have an easier time building a great portfolio, and it can even speed up the process of developing your style a bit (it'll still take time, but passion projects make the process more fun).
